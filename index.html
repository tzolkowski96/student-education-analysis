        <h1>Predicting Portuguese Students' Interest in Higher Education</h1>
        <p>By Tobin Zolkowski</p>
        <p>Part of L I S 706 â€” Data Mining Planning and Management during my Information M.S. program, Spring 2022</p>
    </header>
    
    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><i class="icon">&#128204;</i> <strong>Objective:</strong> The main goal is to predict whether students who are interested in pursuing higher education are more likely to consume alcohol. This involves analyzing various factors including demographics (like age and gender), academic performance (like grades), and social habits (like drinking alcohol).</p>
        <p><i class="icon">&#128204;</i> <strong>Dataset Source:</strong> The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, a website where people can share data and data projects. This specific dataset focuses on student alcohol consumption in Portuguese language courses. The dataset link is: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption">Kaggle - Student Alcohol Consumption</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains information about 649 students, with 33 different attributes (features) for each student. Here are the key attributes analyzed in this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128100;</i> <strong>sex:</strong> The student's gender (female or male).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128100;</i> <strong>age:</strong> The student's age (ranging from 15 to 22 years old).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127891;</i> <strong>higher:</strong> Indicates whether the student intends to pursue higher education (yes or no).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127867;</i> <strong>Walc:</strong> The level of alcohol consumption on weekends (on a scale from 1, very low, to 5, very high).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127793;</i> <strong>health:</strong> The student's current health status (on a scale from 1, very bad, to 5, very good).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128337;</i> <strong>absences:</strong> The number of school absences (ranging from 0 to 93).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
        <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process where we look at the data and summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods. This helps us understand the patterns in the data and decide how to handle it.</p>
        <p>Data Types: The dataset includes both categorical data (which can be divided into groups, like gender) and numerical data (which are numbers, like age).</p>
        <p>Categorical variables like sex and higher were visualized using bar plots. These plots show how many students fall into each category. Numerical variables like age and absences were visualized using histograms, which show the distribution of these numbers among the students.</p>
        <h4>Distributions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Most students (70%) are interested in pursuing higher education.</li>
            <li>Alcohol consumption on weekends (Walc) is more prevalent than on weekdays (Dalc).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>Before applying machine learning models, we need to prepare the data. This includes several steps:</p>
        <h4>Handling Missing Values:</h4>
        <p>We checked the dataset and confirmed there were no missing values, meaning we had complete data for all students.</p>
        <h4>Encoding Categorical Variables:</h4>
        <p>Some machine learning models require numerical input. So, we converted categorical variables (like sex and higher) into numerical values using a method called one-hot encoding. For example, "female" might be represented as 1 and "male" as 0.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
        <p>We used several machine learning models to predict whether a student aspires to higher education. Here's a brief explanation of the key concepts:</p>
        <h4>Class Imbalance Handling:</h4>
        <p>Our dataset had more students interested in higher education than those who were not, creating an imbalance. To address this, we used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.</p>
        <h4>Data Splitting:</h4>
        <p>We divided the dataset into three parts: training (80% of the data), testing (10%), and validation (10%). This helps ensure our models are trained and tested properly.</p>

        <h3>Baseline Models</h3>
        <p>Baseline models provide a point of comparison for more complex models. If a complex model doesn't perform significantly better than a baseline model, it may not be useful.</p>
        <h4>DummyClassifier:</h4>
        <p>This model predicts the most frequent class (like always predicting "yes" for higher education). It achieved a test set accuracy of 42.24% and a holdout set accuracy of 52.99%. This means it correctly predicted 42.24% of the test cases and 52.99% of the holdout cases.</p>

        <h3>Gaussian Naive Bayes</h3>
        <p>This model is simple and effective for many tasks. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and independent. It achieved a test set accuracy of 71.55% and a holdout set accuracy of 66.67%.</p>

        <h3>Decision Tree</h3>
        <p>This model splits the data into branches to make predictions. Each split is based on the feature that provides the most information. Parameters were set to prevent overfitting (when a model is too closely fitted to the training data and performs poorly on new data):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Criterion: 'gini' (a measure of impurity)</li>
            <li>Max Depth: 10 (limits the number of splits)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Split: 2 (minimum number of samples required to split an internal node)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Leaf: 1 (minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)</li>
            <li>Cost Complexity Pruning Parameter: 0.005 (used to prune the tree and reduce complexity)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accuracy: 75.86% on the test set and 64.10% on the holdout set.</p>
        <p>Insights: Younger students and females with fewer health issues and absences are more likely to pursue higher education.</p>
        <img src="image_42.png" alt="Decision Tree Visualization">

        <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
        <p>This model predicts the probability of a binary outcome (like yes or no) using a logistic function. It calculates a weighted sum of the input features and applies a logistic transformation to predict the outcome.</p>
        <p>Parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Penalty: 'l2' (regularization to prevent overfitting)</li>
            <li>C: 1 (inverse of regularization strength)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Test Set Metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: 67.24% (correct predictions out of total predictions)</li>
            <li>Precision: 60.78% (true positive predictions out of all positive predictions)</li>
            <li>Recall: 63.27% (true positive predictions out of all actual positives)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Evaluation Methods:</h4>
        <p>Confusion Matrix:</p>
        <img src="image_43.png" alt="Confusion Matrix">
        <p>The confusion matrix shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.</p>
        <p>ROC Curve:</p>
        <img src="image_44.png" alt="ROC Curve">
        <p>The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values. The area under the curve (AUC) indicates the model's performance, with 1 being perfect and 0.5 being no better than random guessing. An AUC of 0.78 indicates good performance.</p>

        <h3>Random Forest Regression</h3>
        <p>This model is an ensemble of decision trees. It improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.</p>
        <p>Parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of Trees: 97 (number of decision trees in the forest)</li>
            <li>Max Depth: 10 (limits the number of splits)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Split: 3 (minimum number of samples required to split an internal node)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Leaf: 1 (minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)</li>
            <li>Cost Complexity Pruning Parameter: 0 (used to prune the tree and reduce complexity)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Performance Metrics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mean Absolute Error: 0.2359 (average magnitude of the errors)</li>
            <li>Mean Squared Error: 0.1071 (average squared difference between predicted and actual values)</li>
            <li>Root Mean Squared Error: 0.3273 (square root of the mean squared error, gives an idea of the size of the error)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feature Importance:</h4>
        <p>Age, absences, and weekend alcohol consumption (Walc) were found to be the most important predictors.</p>
        <img src="image_47.png" alt="Feature Importance">

        <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
        <p>Random Search: Conducted to optimize the Random Forest model parameters. This involves searching over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of parameters.</p>
        <p>Best Parameters Found:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>n_estimators: 85 (number of trees in the forest)</li>
            <li>max_depth: 10 (maximum depth of the tree)</li>
            <li>min_samples_split: 2 (minimum number of samples required to split an internal node)</li>
            <li>min_samples_leaf: 2 (minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)</li>
            <li>ccp_alpha: 0 (complexity parameter used for minimal cost-complexity pruning)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary of Key Factors</h2>
        <p>Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified several key factors influencing Portuguese students' interests in continuing education and their drinking habits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absences and Age:</strong> Significant predictors of academic performance and higher education aspiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental and Family Support:</strong> Strong influence on students' educational aspirations and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Moderate influence on overall academic performance and aspirations.</li>
            <li><strong>Extracurricular Activities and Free Time:</strong> Balanced participation in extracurricular activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights help understand the various factors affecting students' educational aspirations and behaviors, and they can inform strategies for improving educational outcomes and support systems for students.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The project provided insights into how demographic, academic, and social factors influence students' aspirations for higher education. It highlighted the complexity of the relationship between alcohol consumption and educational aspirations, suggesting that other factors like age and absenteeism are more critical predictors.</p>
        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
        <p>Thank you to everyone who supported and guided me throughout this project. Special thanks to Kaggle for providing the dataset and to the community for valuable feedback and suggestions.</p>
        <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, I handled data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. One of the key challenges was addressing the class imbalance in the dataset, which I resolved using SMOTE. Another challenge was optimizing the hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which I tackled using RandomizedSearchCV. My favorite part of this project was diving deep into the data and uncovering insights that were not immediately obvious.</p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>Future research could involve longitudinal studies to track changes in students' interests over time, using larger and more diverse datasets to validate findings, and exploring advanced modeling techniques like neural networks to uncover more complex patterns.</p>
