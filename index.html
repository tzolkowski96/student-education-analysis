        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128204;</i> <strong>Objective:</strong> Have you ever wondered what drives students to pursue higher education—and what factors might influence their choices along the way? In this project, I set out to predict whether Portuguese students interested in continuing their education are also more likely to consume alcohol. To do this, I dove into a rich dataset, exploring everything from demographics (like age and gender) to academic performance and social habits.</p>

        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset at the heart of this project includes detailed information on <strong>649 students</strong>, each described by <strong>33 different attributes</strong>. These features range from basic demographics to more nuanced aspects of student life. Here are some of the key variables I focused on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128100;</i> <strong>sex:</strong> Gender of the student (female or male).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128100;</i> <strong>age:</strong> Age, ranging from 15 to 22 years old.</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127891;</i> <strong>higher:</strong> Whether the student plans to pursue higher education (yes or no).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127867;</i> <strong>Walc:</strong> Weekend alcohol consumption, rated from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127793;</i> <strong>health:</strong> Current health status, from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128337;</i> <strong>absences:</strong> Number of school absences (0 to 93).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By analyzing these and other features, I was able to build a comprehensive view of the student population and the factors that might influence their educational journeys.</p>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>How Did I Approach the Problem?</h3>
        <p>Every good data science project starts with a plan. Here’s how I tackled this one, step by step:</p>
        <h4>1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>
        <p>Before jumping into modeling, I spent time getting to know the data. I explored both categorical variables (like gender and school support) and numerical ones (like age and absences), using bar plots and histograms to visualize distributions and spot trends. For example, I found that most students (about 70%) expressed interest in higher education, and that weekend alcohol consumption was more common than weekday drinking.</p>
        <h4>2. Data Preprocessing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> Good news—there were no missing values in the dataset, so I could work with complete records for every student.</li>
            <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables:</strong> To make the data suitable for machine learning, I converted categorical variables into numbers using one-hot encoding. For instance, "female" became 1 and "male" became 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Handling Class Imbalance</h4>
        <p>One challenge was that more students wanted to pursue higher education than not, creating an imbalance. To address this, I used <strong>SMOTE</strong> (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, ensuring the models wouldn’t be biased toward the majority.</p>
        <h4>4. Data Splitting</h4>
        <p>I split the data into three sets: <strong>training (80%)</strong>, <strong>testing (10%)</strong>, and <strong>validation (10%)</strong>. This approach helped me train robust models and fairly evaluate their performance.</p>
        <h4>5. Model Selection and Evaluation</h4>
        <p>I experimented with several machine learning models, each offering unique strengths:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DummyClassifier:</strong> A simple baseline that always predicts the most frequent class. It achieved 42.24% accuracy on the test set and 52.99% on the holdout set—useful for comparison, but not much else!</li>
            <li><strong>Gaussian Naive Bayes:</strong> This model assumes features are independent and normally distributed. It performed much better, with 71.55% test accuracy and 66.67% on the holdout set.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> By splitting the data based on the most informative features, this model reached 75.86% accuracy on the test set and 64.10% on the holdout set. Key insights: younger students and females with fewer health issues and absences are more likely to pursue higher education.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> This model predicts the probability of a binary outcome. With regularization to prevent overfitting, it achieved 67.24% accuracy, 60.78% precision, and 63.27% recall on the test set. The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.78—quite good!</li>
            <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> An ensemble of decision trees, this model benefited from hyperparameter tuning (using Random Search) to optimize its performance. The best configuration used 85 trees, a max depth of 10, and minimal pruning. It delivered strong results, with a mean absolute error of 0.2359 and root mean squared error of 0.3273. Feature importance analysis highlighted age, absences, and weekend alcohol consumption as top predictors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>6. Hyperparameter Tuning</h4>
        <p>To squeeze out the best performance, I used Random Search to explore different parameter combinations for the Random Forest model. This process helped me find the sweet spot for accuracy and generalization.</p>

    <section id="feature-engineering">
        <h2>Custom Feature Engineering & Advanced Modeling</h2>
        <p>To go beyond the basics, I got creative with feature engineering and tried out advanced algorithms. Here’s what I did:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Composite Risk Score:</strong> I combined absences, alcohol consumption, and health into a single metric to better identify at-risk students. This new feature captured the interplay between these factors in a way that individual variables couldn’t.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Features:</strong> Recognizing that parental support and academic performance are deeply connected, I created new features to represent their interaction. This allowed the models to pick up on more subtle patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Models:</strong> I implemented Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, two powerful algorithms known for capturing complex, non-linear relationships. The XGBoost model, in particular, achieved an impressive AUC of 0.82, outperforming the simpler models and demonstrating the value of thoughtful feature engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The bar chart below, generated using Plotly, interactively displays which features the XGBoost model found most important for predicting students’ aspirations for higher education. You can hover over the bars to see the exact importance scores.</p>

        <h2>Visual Insights</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, a picture really is worth a thousand words. Here are some of the most revealing visualizations from my analysis, each accompanied by a brief explanation of what it shows and why it matters.</p>
        <div class="visual-insights">
            <div class="fade-in">
                <h3>School Distribution</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/image_1.png" alt="School Distribution">
                <p>This bar chart provides a clear picture of how students are distributed across two schools: "GP" (Gabriel Pereira) and "MS" (Mousinho da Silveira). The data reveals that Gabriel Pereira is by far the more popular choice, with approximately 350 students enrolled, while Mousinho da Silveira has a much smaller student body of about 50. This disparity may reflect differences in school reputation, location, or available programs, and sets the stage for further analysis of how school environment influences student outcomes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in">
                <h3>Gender Distribution</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/image_2.png" alt="Gender Distribution">
                <p>Here, we see the gender breakdown of the student population. Female students slightly outnumber their male counterparts, with around 200 females and 180 males. This near balance suggests that both genders are well represented in the dataset, allowing for meaningful comparisons in subsequent analyses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in">
                <h3>Address Distribution</h3>

        <h3>1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration (Python)</h3>
        <p>The first step involved loading the dataset using Pandas and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, identify data types, and get a first look at distributions.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Python snippet for loading data with Pandas
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('student_data.csv') # Assuming the data is in a CSV file

# Display basic information
print(df.info())

# Show a few rows
print(df.head())

# Example: Plotting distribution of 'age'
sns.histplot(df['age'], kde=True)
plt.title('Age Distribution of Students')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
        </code></pre>
        <p><em>This snippet demonstrates how Pandas was used for data handling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for initial visualizations, such as checking the age distribution.</em></p>

        <h3>2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (Python)</h3>
        <p>Data preprocessing was crucial. This involved encoding all relevant categorical variables (e.g., 'sex', 'address', 'school') into numerical format, typically using techniques like one-hot encoding, to ensure the feature set <code>X</code> was entirely numeric. Subsequently, class imbalances for the target variable ('higher') were addressed, for instance, using SMOTE. I also engineered new features like the 'Composite Risk Score'.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Python snippet for one-hot encoding and SMOTE
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load preprocessed data
df = pd.read_csv('student_data.csv')

# Encode binary target variable 'higher'
le = LabelEncoder()
df['higher_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(df['higher'])

# Create Composite Risk Score by scaling and combining key risk factors
# First scale the relevant features to a common range (0-1)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
risk_features = df[['absences', 'Walc', 'health']]
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(risk_features)

# Create a DataFrame with scaled values for better readability
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(
    scaled_features, 
    columns=['absences_scaled', 'Walc_scaled', 'health_scaled']
)

# Higher score = higher risk (note we invert health since higher health = lower risk)
df['composite_risk_score'] = (
    scaled_df['absences_scaled'] + 
    scaled_df['Walc_scaled'] + 
    (1 - scaled_df['health_scaled'])
) / 3

# Prepare features (X) and target (y) for modeling
X = df.drop(['higher', 'higher_encoded'], axis=1)
y = df['higher_encoded']

# One-hot encode categorical variables
categorical_cols = ['sex', 'address', 'famsize', 'Pstatus', 'Mjob', 
                    'Fjob', 'reason', 'guardian', 'schoolsup', 'famsup']
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)

print(f"Shape before SMOTE: {X.shape}, {y.shape}")

# Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

print(f"Shape after SMOTE: {X_resampled.shape}, {y_resampled.shape}")
print(f"Class distribution after SMOTE: {np.bincount(y_resampled)}")
        </code></pre>
        <p><em>This illustrates the use of Scikit-learn for encoding and Imbalanced-learn for SMOTE to ensure fair model training. Feature engineering steps, like creating the composite score, were also performed here.</em></p>

        <h3>3. Model Training and Evaluation (Python)</h3>
        <p>Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated. The Random Forest and XGBoost models were particularly effective. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV.</p>

        <h2>Model Insights & Interpretation</h2>
        <p>The predictive modeling phase culminated in the XGBoost model demonstrating the highest performance, achieving an <strong>Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.82</strong>. This indicates a strong capability to distinguish between students who aspire to higher education and those who do not. The full model evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are available in the <a href="https://github.com/tzolkowski96/tzolkowski96/blob/main/portuguese-students-higher-education-analysis/Machine%20learning%20project_%20Portuguese%20students'%20interests%20in%20continuing%20education%20and%20their%20drinking%20habits.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete notebook</a>.</p>
        <p>The feature importance analysis from the XGBoost model (visualized in the "Feature Engineering" section) revealed several key factors influencing students' higher education aspirations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absences:</strong> This was a highly significant predictor. A higher number of absences often correlates with lower academic engagement and performance, which can understandably dampen aspirations for further studies. It may signal underlying issues that need attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger students in the dataset (typically 15-17) showed a stronger inclination towards higher education. This is logical as they are at a stage where higher education is often the presumed next step. Older students within this cohort might be exploring alternative paths or facing different life circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>Weekend Alcohol Consumption (Walc):</strong> The model identified this as an important feature. The project's initial objective included exploring the link between higher education interest and alcohol consumption. While this model predicts interest in higher education *using* Walc as a feature, the importance of Walc suggests a notable interplay. It doesn't necessarily mean high Walc *prevents* higher education interest (as seen in some visualizations where many students with high Walc still aspire to HE), but it indicates that patterns of weekend alcohol use are statistically relevant in profiling students regarding their educational outlook. This could be due to social factors, coping mechanisms, or other correlated behaviors that indirectly influence or signal a student's engagement with their academic future.</li>
            <li><strong>Health:</strong> General health status also played a role. Poorer health can be a significant barrier to academic pursuits, affecting attendance, concentration, and overall motivation.</li>
            <li><strong>Composite Risk Score:</strong> The custom-engineered 'Composite Risk Score' (combining absences, alcohol, and health) proved its value by ranking as an important predictor. This confirms that a holistic view of these risk factors is more informative than looking at them in complete isolation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Implications:</strong> These insights can be valuable for educators, counselors, and policymakers. For instance, tracking absences diligently and intervening early could be crucial. Understanding the social and personal factors related to alcohol consumption and health can help in designing targeted support systems. The findings suggest that addressing a combination of academic, social, and health-related factors is key to fostering students' aspirations for continued education.</p>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This data mining project aimed to predict Portuguese students' interest in pursuing higher education, while also exploring factors like alcohol consumption. Leveraging a dataset of 649 students and 33 attributes from Kaggle, the project involved a comprehensive analytical process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Uncovered initial trends and distributions within the data, including demographics, academic performance, and lifestyle habits.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Included one-hot encoding for categorical variables and addressing class imbalance in the target variable ('higher') using SMOTE.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Developed new insightful features, such as a 'Composite Risk Score' combining absences, alcohol consumption, and health.</li>
            <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Evaluated several machine learning models, with <strong>XGBoost</strong> emerging as the top performer, achieving an AUC of 0.82. Other models like Random Forest and Decision Trees also provided valuable insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> The most influential predictors for higher education aspiration were identified as school absences, age, weekend alcohol consumption, health status, and the engineered composite risk score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project successfully demonstrated the application of data mining techniques to gain actionable insights into student behavior and aspirations. The "Live Demo" feature on this website provides a simplified interactive way to explore these predictions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion & Future Directions</h2>
        <p>This project successfully developed a predictive model that identifies factors associated with Portuguese students' interest in higher education. The findings highlight the interconnectedness of academic engagement (absences), demographic factors (age), lifestyle choices (weekend alcohol consumption), and well-being (health).</p>
        
        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dataset Specificity:</strong> The insights are derived from a specific dataset of Portuguese students and may not generalize directly to other populations or educational contexts without further validation.</li>
            <li><strong>Correlation vs. Causation:</strong> While the models identify strong statistical associations, they do not inherently prove causation. For example, while higher weekend alcohol consumption is a predictive feature, this analysis alone doesn't define the exact causal nature of its relationship with higher education aspirations.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Reported Data:</strong> Some data points, like alcohol consumption, are self-reported and might be subject to biases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future Work:</h3>
        <p>Several avenues could be explored to build upon this research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Qualitative Research:</strong> Complementing these quantitative findings with qualitative studies (e.g., student interviews) could provide deeper context and understanding of the "why" behind the observed patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Longitudinal Study:</strong> Tracking students over time would offer more robust insights into how these factors evolve and influence actual educational attainment, not just aspiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Intervention Strategies:</strong> Designing and testing targeted intervention programs based on the identified risk factors (e.g., support for students with high absences or specific health concerns) could be a practical application.</li>
            <li><strong>Broader Datasets:</strong> Incorporating data from diverse student populations and geographical locations would enhance the generalizability of the findings.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Feature Engineering:</strong> Exploring more complex interaction terms or deriving features from unstructured data (if available, e.g., student essays) could yield further improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Collaboration:</strong> I welcome collaborations and contributions to this project. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tzolkowski96/tzolkowski96/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open an issue</a> or submit a pull request on GitHub with suggestions or improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conclusion, this project serves as a solid foundation for understanding the multifaceted influences on students' educational paths. By continuing to refine these analytical approaches and exploring new data, we can better support students in achieving their academic goals.</p>
