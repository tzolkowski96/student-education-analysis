        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><i class="icon">&#128204;</i> <strong>Objective:</strong> The main goal is to predict whether students who are interested in pursuing higher education are more likely to consume alcohol. This involves analyzing various factors including demographics (like age and gender), academic performance (like grades), and social habits (like drinking alcohol).</p>
        <p><i class="icon">&#128204;</i> <strong>Dataset Source:</strong> The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, a website where people can share data and data projects. This specific dataset focuses on student alcohol consumption in Portuguese language courses. The dataset link is: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption">Kaggle - Student Alcohol Consumption</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains information about 649 students, with 33 different attributes (features) for each student. Here are the key attributes analyzed in this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128100;</i> <strong>sex:</strong> The student's gender (female or male).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128100;</i> <strong>age:</strong> The student's age (ranging from 15 to 22 years old).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127891;</i> <strong>higher:</strong> Indicates whether the student intends to pursue higher education (yes or no).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127867;</i> <strong>Walc:</strong> The level of alcohol consumption on weekends (on a scale from 1, very low, to 5, very high).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#127793;</i> <strong>health:</strong> The student's current health status (on a scale from 1, very bad, to 5, very good).</li>
            <li><i class="icon">&#128337;</i> <strong>absences:</strong> The number of school absences (ranging from 0 to 93).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
        <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process where we look at the data and summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods. This helps us understand the patterns in the data and decide how to handle it.</p>
        <p>Data Types: The dataset includes both categorical data (which can be divided into groups, like gender) and numerical data (which are numbers, like age).</p>
        <p>Categorical variables like sex and higher were visualized using bar plots. These plots show how many students fall into each category. Numerical variables like age and absences were visualized using histograms, which show the distribution of these numbers among the students.</p>
        <h4>Distributions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Most students (70%) are interested in pursuing higher education.</li>
            <li>Alcohol consumption on weekends (Walc) is more prevalent than on weekdays (Dalc).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>Before applying machine learning models, we need to prepare the data. This includes several steps:</p>
        <h4>Handling Missing Values:</h4>
        <p>We checked the dataset and confirmed there were no missing values, meaning we had complete data for all students.</p>
        <h4>Encoding Categorical Variables:</h4>
        <p>Some machine learning models require numerical input. So, we converted categorical variables (like sex and higher) into numerical values using a method called one-hot encoding. For example, "female" might be represented as 1 and "male" as 0.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
        <p>We used several machine learning models to predict whether a student aspires to higher education. Here's a brief explanation of the key concepts:</p>
        <h4>Class Imbalance Handling:</h4>
        <p>Our dataset had more students interested in higher education than those who were not, creating an imbalance. To address this, we used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.</p>
        <h4>Data Splitting:</h4>
        <p>We divided the dataset into three parts: training (80% of the data), testing (10%), and validation (10%). This helps ensure our models are trained and tested properly.</p>

        <h3>Baseline Models</h3>
        <p>Baseline models provide a point of comparison for more complex models. If a complex model doesn't perform significantly better than a baseline model, it may not be useful.</p>
        <h4>DummyClassifier:</h4>
        <p>This model predicts the most frequent class (like always predicting "yes" for higher education). It achieved a test set accuracy of 42.24% and a holdout set accuracy of 52.99%. This means it correctly predicted 42.24% of the test cases and 52.99% of the holdout cases.</p>

        <h3>Gaussian Naive Bayes</h3>
        <p>This model is simple and effective for many tasks. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and independent. It achieved a test set accuracy of 71.55% and a holdout set accuracy of 66.67%.</p>

        <h3>Decision Tree</h3>
        <p>This model splits the data into branches to make predictions. Each split is based on the feature that provides the most information. Parameters were set to prevent overfitting (when a model is too closely fitted to the training data and performs poorly on new data):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Criterion: 'gini' (a measure of impurity)</li>
            <li>Max Depth: 10 (limits the number of splits)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Split: 2 (minimum number of samples required to split an internal node)</li>
            <li>Min Samples Leaf: 1 (minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)</li>
            <li>Cost Complexity Pruning Parameter: 0.005 (used to prune the tree and reduce complexity)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accuracy: 75.86% on the test set and 64.10% on the holdout set.</p>
        <p>Insights: Younger students and females with fewer health issues and absences are more likely to pursue higher education.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/image_42.png" alt="Decision Tree Visualization">

        <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
        <p>This model predicts the probability of a binary outcome (like yes or no) using a logistic function. It calculates a weighted sum of the input features and applies a logistic transformation to predict the outcome.</p>
        <p>Parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Penalty: 'l2' (regularization to prevent overfitting)</li>
            <li>C: 1 (inverse of regularization strength)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Test Set Metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: 67.24% (correct predictions out of total predictions)</li>
            <li>Precision: 60.78% (true positive predictions out of all positive predictions)</li>
            <li>Recall: 63.27% (true positive predictions out of all actual positives)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Evaluation Methods:</h4>
        <p>Confusion Matrix:</p>
        <img src="assets/images/image_43.png" alt="Confusion Matrix">
        <p>The confusion matrix shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.</p>
        <p>ROC Curve:</p>
        <img src="assets/images/image_44.png" alt="ROC Curve">
        <p>The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values. The area under the curve (AUC) indicates the model's performance, with 1 being perfect and 0.5 being no better than random guessing. An AUC of 0.78 indicates good performance.</p>

        <h3>Random Forest Regression</h3>
        <p>This model is an ensemble of decision trees. It improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.</p>
        <p>To further enhance the performance of the Random Forest model, I conducted a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization using Random Search. This process involved systematically exploring a wide range of parameter combinations to identify the most effective settings for the model. By searching over a carefully defined parameter grid, I was able to pinpoint the configuration that yielded the best predictive results.</p>
        <p><strong>Best Parameters Identified:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>n_estimators: 85</strong> &mdash; This represents the number of trees in the forest. A higher number of trees generally improves performance, but also increases computational cost. Through tuning, 85 was found to be the optimal balance.</li>
            <li><strong>max_depth: 10</strong> &mdash; This parameter controls the maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth helps prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to new data.</li>
            <li><strong>min_samples_split: 2</strong> &mdash; This is the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Setting this to 2 allows the model to consider all possible splits, capturing subtle patterns in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>min_samples_leaf: 2</strong> &mdash; This parameter specifies the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. By increasing this value slightly, the model avoids creating leaves that are too specific to the training data.</li>
            <li><strong>ccp_alpha: 0</strong> &mdash; The complexity parameter for minimal cost-complexity pruning. A value of 0 means no additional pruning was applied, allowing the model to retain all splits deemed important by the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Performance Metrics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mean Absolute Error: 0.2359 (average magnitude of the errors)</li>
            <li>Mean Squared Error: 0.1071 (average squared difference between predicted and actual values)</li>
            <li>Root Mean Squared Error: 0.3273 (square root of the mean squared error, gives an idea of the size of the error)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feature Importance:</h4>
        <p>Age, absences, and weekend alcohol consumption (Walc) were found to be the most important predictors.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/image_47.png" alt="Feature Importance">

        <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
        <p>Random Search: Conducted to optimize the Random Forest model parameters. This involves searching over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of parameters.</p>
        <p>Best Parameters Found:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>n_estimators: 85 (number of trees in the forest)</li>
            <li>max_depth: 10 (maximum depth of the tree)</li>
            <li>min_samples_split: 2 (minimum number of samples required to split an internal node)</li>
            <li>min_samples_leaf: 2 (minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node)</li>
            <li>ccp_alpha: 0 (complexity parameter used for minimal cost-complexity pruning)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Custom Feature Engineering & Advanced Modeling</h2>
        <p>To push the boundaries of this analysis and extract deeper insights, I went beyond standard modeling by engineering new features and experimenting with advanced algorithms. Feature engineering is a creative process that involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. Here’s how I approached it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Composite Risk Score:</strong> I developed a new metric that combines absences, alcohol consumption, and health into a single risk score. This composite feature helps to better identify students who may be at risk, capturing the interplay between these important factors in a way that individual features cannot.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Features:</strong> Recognizing that the relationship between parental support and academic performance can be complex, I created new features to represent these interactions. This allowed the models to account for the combined effect of family environment and student achievement, leading to more nuanced predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Models:</strong> Building on these engineered features, I implemented state-of-the-art algorithms such as Gradient Boosting and XGBoost. These models are known for their ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in data. Impressively, the XGBoost model achieved an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of up to 0.82, outperforming the baseline models and demonstrating the value of thoughtful feature engineering and model selection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The bar chart below visualizes the importance of each feature as determined by the XGBoost model, highlighting which factors had the greatest impact on predicting students’ aspirations for higher education.</p>

                <p>This bar chart provides a clear picture of how students are distributed across two schools: "GP" (Gabriel Pereira) and "MS" (Mousinho da Silveira). The data reveals that Gabriel Pereira is by far the more popular choice, with approximately 350 students enrolled, while Mousinho da Silveira has a much smaller student body of about 50. This disparity may reflect differences in school reputation, location, or available programs, and sets the stage for further analysis of how school environment influences student outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Key Factors</h2>
        <p>Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified several key factors influencing Portuguese students' interests in continuing education and their drinking habits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absences and Age:</strong> Significant predictors of academic performance and higher education aspiration.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental and Family Support:</strong> Strong influence on students' educational aspirations and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Moderate influence on overall academic performance and aspirations.</li>
            <li><strong>Extracurricular Activities and Free Time:</strong> Balanced participation in extracurricular activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights help understand the various factors affecting students' educational aspirations and behaviors, and they can inform strategies for improving educational outcomes and support systems for students.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The project provided insights into how demographic, academic, and social factors influence students' aspirations for higher education. It highlighted the complexity of the relationship between alcohol consumption and educational aspirations, suggesting that other factors like age and absenteeism are more critical predictors.</p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>While this project has uncovered valuable insights into the factors influencing Portuguese students' aspirations for higher education, there is still much more to explore. One promising direction for future research is the use of longitudinal studies. By following students over several years, we could gain a deeper understanding of how their interests, habits, and aspirations evolve over time, and what life events or interventions have the greatest impact on their educational journeys.</p>
        <p>Additionally, expanding the dataset to include a larger and more diverse group of students would help validate the findings and ensure that the conclusions are robust across different regions, backgrounds, and school systems. This could involve collaborating with schools, educational organizations, or even leveraging open data initiatives to gather richer information.</p>
        <p>On the technical side, there is exciting potential in exploring advanced modeling techniques. For example, neural networks and deep learning approaches could be used to capture even more complex patterns in the data, especially if more features or unstructured data (like text responses or social media activity) are available. Ensemble methods, transfer learning, and explainable AI are also promising avenues that could make the models both more accurate and more interpretable for educators and policymakers.</p>
        <p>Finally, future work could focus on translating these insights into actionable strategies for schools and families. This might include developing early warning systems to identify at-risk students, designing targeted interventions, or creating interactive dashboards to help educators visualize and respond to student needs in real time.</p>

        <h3>Personal Contributions</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, I handled data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. One of the key challenges was addressing the class imbalance in the dataset, which I resolved using SMOTE. Another challenge was optimizing the hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which I tackled using RandomizedSearchCV. My favorite part of this project was diving deep into the data and uncovering insights that were not immediately obvious.</p>
