        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128204;</i> <strong>Objective:</strong> Have you ever wondered what drives students to pursue higher education—and what factors might influence their choices along the way? In this project, I set out to predict whether Portuguese students interested in continuing their education are also more likely to consume alcohol. To do this, I dove into a rich dataset, exploring everything from demographics (like age and gender) to academic performance and social habits.</p>
        <p><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128204;</i> <strong>Dataset Source:</strong> The data for this project comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption" target="_blank">Kaggle's Student Alcohol Consumption</a> dataset. This resource offers a fascinating look at the lives of students enrolled in Portuguese language courses, capturing a wide range of variables that help paint a detailed picture of their academic and personal lives.</p>
        <p>Throughout this journey, my goal was to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that could help educators, parents, and policymakers better understand the factors shaping students' aspirations—and perhaps even inform strategies to support them on their educational paths.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>The dataset at the heart of this project includes detailed information on <strong>649 students</strong>, each described by <strong>33 different attributes</strong>. These features range from basic demographics to more nuanced aspects of student life. Here are some of the key variables I focused on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128100;</i> <strong>sex:</strong> Gender of the student (female or male).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128100;</i> <strong>age:</strong> Age, ranging from 15 to 22 years old.</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127891;</i> <strong>higher:</strong> Whether the student plans to pursue higher education (yes or no).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127867;</i> <strong>Walc:</strong> Weekend alcohol consumption, rated from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127793;</i> <strong>health:</strong> Current health status, from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).</li>
            <li><i class="icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128337;</i> <strong>absences:</strong> Number of school absences (0 to 93).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By analyzing these and other features, I was able to build a comprehensive view of the student population and the factors that might influence their educational journeys.</p>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>How Did I Approach the Problem?</h3>
        <p>Every good data science project starts with a plan. Here’s how I tackled this one, step by step:</p>
        <h4>1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>
        <p>Before jumping into modeling, I spent time getting to know the data. I explored both categorical variables (like gender and school support) and numerical ones (like age and absences), using bar plots and histograms to visualize distributions and spot trends. For example, I found that most students (about 70%) expressed interest in higher education, and that weekend alcohol consumption was more common than weekday drinking.</p>
        <h4>2. Data Preprocessing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> Good news—there were no missing values in the dataset, so I could work with complete records for every student.</li>
            <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables:</strong> To make the data suitable for machine learning, I converted categorical variables into numbers using one-hot encoding. For instance, "female" became 1 and "male" became 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Handling Class Imbalance</h4>
        <p>One challenge was that more students wanted to pursue higher education than not, creating an imbalance. To address this, I used <strong>SMOTE</strong> (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, ensuring the models wouldn’t be biased toward the majority.</p>
        <h4>4. Data Splitting</h4>
        <p>I split the data into three sets: <strong>training (80%)</strong>, <strong>testing (10%)</strong>, and <strong>validation (10%)</strong>. This approach helped me train robust models and fairly evaluate their performance.</p>
        <h4>5. Model Selection and Evaluation</h4>
        <p>I experimented with several machine learning models, each offering unique strengths:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DummyClassifier:</strong> A simple baseline that always predicts the most frequent class. It achieved 42.24% accuracy on the test set and 52.99% on the holdout set—useful for comparison, but not much else!</li>
            <li><strong>Gaussian Naive Bayes:</strong> This model assumes features are independent and normally distributed. It performed much better, with 71.55% test accuracy and 66.67% on the holdout set.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> By splitting the data based on the most informative features, this model reached 75.86% accuracy on the test set and 64.10% on the holdout set. Key insights: younger students and females with fewer health issues and absences are more likely to pursue higher education.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> This model predicts the probability of a binary outcome. With regularization to prevent overfitting, it achieved 67.24% accuracy, 60.78% precision, and 63.27% recall on the test set. The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.78—quite good!</li>
            <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> An ensemble of decision trees, this model benefited from hyperparameter tuning (using Random Search) to optimize its performance. The best configuration used 85 trees, a max depth of 10, and minimal pruning. It delivered strong results, with a mean absolute error of 0.2359 and root mean squared error of 0.3273. Feature importance analysis highlighted age, absences, and weekend alcohol consumption as top predictors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>6. Hyperparameter Tuning</h4>
        <p>To squeeze out the best performance, I used Random Search to explore different parameter combinations for the Random Forest model. This process helped me find the sweet spot for accuracy and generalization.</p>

        <h2>Custom Feature Engineering & Advanced Modeling</h2>
        <p>To go beyond the basics, I got creative with feature engineering and tried out advanced algorithms. Here’s what I did:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Composite Risk Score:</strong> I combined absences, alcohol consumption, and health into a single metric to better identify at-risk students. This new feature captured the interplay between these factors in a way that individual variables couldn’t.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Features:</strong> Recognizing that parental support and academic performance are deeply connected, I created new features to represent their interaction. This allowed the models to pick up on more subtle patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Models:</strong> I implemented Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, two powerful algorithms known for capturing complex, non-linear relationships. The XGBoost model, in particular, achieved an impressive AUC of 0.82, outperforming the simpler models and demonstrating the value of thoughtful feature engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The bar chart below shows which features the XGBoost model found most important for predicting students’ aspirations for higher education.</p>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Visual Insights</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, a picture really is worth a thousand words. Here are some of the most revealing visualizations from my analysis, each accompanied by a brief explanation of what it shows and why it matters.</p>
        <div class="visual-insights">
            <div class="fade-in">
                <h3>School Distribution</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/image_1.png" alt="School Distribution">
                <p>This bar chart provides a clear picture of how students are distributed across two schools: "GP" (Gabriel Pereira) and "MS" (Mousinho da Silveira). The data reveals that Gabriel Pereira is by far the more popular choice, with approximately 350 students enrolled, while Mousinho da Silveira has a much smaller student body of about 50. This disparity may reflect differences in school reputation, location, or available programs, and sets the stage for further analysis of how school environment influences student outcomes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in">
                <h3>Gender Distribution</h3>

        <h2>Summary of Key Factors</h2>
        <p>Through this comprehensive analysis, several key factors emerged as especially influential in shaping Portuguese students’ interests in continuing education and their drinking habits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absences and Age:</strong> These stood out as significant predictors of both academic performance and higher education aspirations.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental and Family Support:</strong> Students with strong support systems were more likely to aim high and perform well.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Alcohol Consumption:</strong> While not the only factors, these played a moderate role in shaping outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Extracurricular Activities and Free Time:</strong> Balanced participation in activities outside the classroom was common among students with positive aspirations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights offer a window into the complex web of influences that shape students’ educational journeys. By understanding these factors, we can better support students as they navigate the path to higher education.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project provided a deep dive into the many factors that influence students’ aspirations for higher education. The findings highlight the complexity of these decisions, showing that while alcohol consumption plays a role, other factors—like age, absenteeism, and family support—are often even more critical.</p>
        <h3>Looking Ahead: Future Work</h3>
        <p>There’s still so much more to explore! In the future, I’d love to see longitudinal studies that follow students over time, revealing how their interests and habits evolve. Expanding the dataset to include more students from diverse backgrounds would also help validate these findings and uncover new patterns.</p>
        <p>On the technical side, there’s exciting potential in advanced modeling techniques—think neural networks, deep learning, and explainable AI. These tools could help us capture even more complex relationships and make the results more actionable for educators and policymakers.</p>

        <h3>Personal Reflections</h3>
        <p>From data wrangling to model tuning, I handled every step of this project. Tackling class imbalance with SMOTE and optimizing the Random Forest model were especially rewarding challenges. My favorite part? Uncovering insights that weren’t immediately obvious and sharing them in a way that’s accessible to everyone.</p>
